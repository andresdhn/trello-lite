# Trello-lite

Trello-lite is a client-side SPA based on the popular 'Kanban' project admin tool [https://trello.com](https://trello.com)

This project was NOT bootstrapped with create-react-app to understand the basics of the whole react project configuration.

Trello-lite was one of the first web applications I built whilst learning the Framework. Hope you enjoy it. I plan to expand the functionalities in the short future.
